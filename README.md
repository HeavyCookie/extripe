# Extripe

Stripe API wrapper in Elixir

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add extripe to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:extripe, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

  2. Ensure `httpoison` is started before your application:

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:httpoison]]
end
```

## Disclaimer

I've only started learning elixir a couple weeks ago.
